# 💬 AI-Powered Finance Advisor Chatbot using LLM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build an **AI-powered finance advisor chatbot** for **small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs)**.  
Using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as GPT, the chatbot provides **real-time insights, predictive analytics, and actionable financial advice**.  

It can answer questions about **cash flow, budgeting, loans, and investments** in plain language, helping business owners make informed financial decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a conversational AI chatbot using LLM for business finance  
- Provide predictive insights on cash flow, investments, and loans  
- Offer recommendations for budgeting and financial decisions  
- Ensure secure handling of financial data

## ✨ Key Features
- 🧠 Natural language understanding powered by LLM  
- 📊 Cash flow forecasting and investment risk assessment  
- 💰 Budgeting and loan recommendations  
- 🖥️ Interactive, user-friendly interface  
- ☁️ Cloud-ready for future deployment

## 🛠️ Technical Overview

### 🔹 Frontend (Planned)
- Web-based interface (**ReactJS / HTML / CSS / JS**)  
- Displays conversation history and allows input of user questions  
- Future dashboard for financial predictions  

### 🔹 Backend
- **Python Flask / FastAPI** server handling API requests  
- Receives user queries → sends them to LLM → returns human-readable responses  
- Integrates ML models for predictive analytics (cash flow, ROI, risk)  

### 🔹 LLM Integration
- Uses **OpenAI GPT API** or **HuggingFace Transformers**  
- Processes queries and generates **context-aware responses**  
- Can be fine-tuned with **business-specific datasets**  

### 🔹 Machine Learning Models
- **Time-Series Forecasting**: ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM for cash flow prediction  
- **Investment & Risk Assessment**: Classification/regression models for ROI and loan risk evaluation  

### 🔹 Database
- **PostgreSQL / MongoDB** to store:  
  - Business transaction history  
  - Budgets and financial plans  
  - User interactions with the chatbot  
- **Secure storage** using encryption (AES/SSL)

## ☁️ Deployment on AWS

- **EC2**: Host backend server (Flask/FastAPI)  
- **RDS**: PostgreSQL database  
- **S3**: Host static frontend files  
- **API Gateway**: Securely expose backend endpoints  
- **Secrets Manager**: Store API keys (OpenAI, DB credentials)  
- **CloudWatch**: Monitor logs & performance  

### 🔄 Deployment Workflow
1. Launch EC2 instance or configure Lambda (serverless backend)  
2. Install Python & dependencies (`requirements.txt`)  
3. Configure environment variables for API keys & database credentials  
4. Connect backend with RDS database  
5. Upload frontend to S3  
6. Configure API Gateway for secure endpoints  
7. Monitor logs & performance with CloudWatch  

### 🚀 Future Scaling
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for high traffic  
- Elastic Beanstalk for backend management  
- Serverless backend via Lambda for cost efficiency
